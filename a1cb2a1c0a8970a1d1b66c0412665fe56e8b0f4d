It represents the number of clients for each lease server (1 server per lease) that can be connected at the same time. \n\nA client can be in one of 3 states:\n  * waiting in the socket accept() queue \n  * connected and owning a lease\n  * connected and waiting for its lease request will be granted or denied\n\nThere can only be one connection in each of the last 2 states, and that count is represented right now by \u0027MAX_CLIENTS\u0027.  It\u0027s a bad name.  I\u0027ll update it and the usage to make it more clear.",
