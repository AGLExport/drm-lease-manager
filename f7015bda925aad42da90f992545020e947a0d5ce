      "message": "Out of curiosity, suppose you\u0027ve tested this on some of our ref HW platforms? Does it work will all kind of planes? \n\nI have a few questions, but I suppose this aren\u0027t really use-cases because the lease manager is basically in between clients and you don\u0027t really have  a local client trying to use the drm nodes, before or after. \n\n- Will the kernel let you create the lease if there\u0027s another user/client already using it?\n\n- Will the kernel let you use the other planes for that CRTC? The assumption here is that another client is using the planes on a different CRTC from a lease, and another client attempts to use a CRTC only to find out  that it has just the primary plane for instance (with the overlay being leased to another CRTC).",
